## File descriptions

Five-path-reachable-verification.wl : As part of the proof that given a (close to) subcubic graph with 5 X-Y paths, there exists a pair of non-adjacent X-Y paths, this script shows that there is a reachable state for every path system.

Four-path-example-testing.wl : This short script verifies that the example provided in the paper of a subcubic graph with four X-Y paths does not contain a pair of non-adjacent X-Y paths.
